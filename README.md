# Fire review

#### The idea it's provide a Live Preview for Firebase users that serve the hosting by functions application. In another words users of command: `firebase serve`
 
 
### Great Achievals:
-  Monitor some required files.
-  Update the page if files has changed timed;

### What you need to do:
-  `const dinamicPath = [
    "index.html",
    "js/main/lightNews.js",
    "/css/style.css"
];`
-  `const  timeUpdate = 1000;`
-  `firePreview(dinamicPath,timeUpdate);`
